# Slapjack

I've managed to find a card game that I would like to translate to a computer game, and 
that card game is Slapjack. It's a two or more player game where the goal is to win all
the cards by being the first to slap each jack as it's placed in the center. I feel
like this could be a simple game to program, although I might be wrong. Hopefully we 
get a chance to make something like this.
